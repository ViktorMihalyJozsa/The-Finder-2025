<h3>Dear Visitors !</h3>
<h3>Welcome to the Finders game !</h3>
<br>
<h2>Using the Finder Game</h2>
<p>In the Finder game, the goal is to avoid all hidden targets on the game board and reveal all other fields.</p>
<p>Click the left mouse button on the fields to reveal them; the number on the revealed field shows how many targets are in the 8 neighboring fields that you need to avoid.</p>
<p>If you are sure that a field has a target underneath, mark it with a flag using the right mouse button (this prevents accidental revealing).</p>
<p>If a field hides a target and you click on it, you lose the game.</p>
<br>
<h2>Basic Gameplay</h2>
<p>• Left Mouse Button: Click on a field to reveal it.</p>
<p>• Right Mouse Button: Flag the suspected target, or another right click removes the flag.</p>
<p>• Reveal: If you discover a field marked with a number, that number will show the number of adjacent targets.</p>
<p>• Auto Reveal: If all adjacent fields around a numbered field have flags, and the number of adjacent fields is the same as the number, the machine will automatically reveal the remaining unmarked adjacent fields.</p>
<br>
<h2>Tips and Strategies</h2>
<p>• Start in the middle: It is often a good idea to start revealing towards the middle of the board, as this will free up more space in one move.</p>
<p>• Watch the numbers: If you have marked as many targets around a numbered field as If the number is the same, all other adjacent spaces are free of targets and you can safely reveal them as well.</p>
<p>• Don't over-mark: Only flag a space if you are sure. Marking flags is not necessarily the fastest way to win.</p>
<p>• Use patterns: Look for patterns, such as the 1-2-1 pattern, which indicates that there is definitely a target under the center square.</p>
<br>
<h2>Use keyboard shortcuts (if available):</h2>
<p>• F2: Start a new game.</p>
<p>• Enter: Reveal a square (when the mouse is over the square).</p>
<p>• Space: Toggle flag/question mark (when the mouse is over the square).</p>
<br>
<h2>Be patient:</h2>
<p>If you are not sure about your next move, slow down and think about your options.</p>
<p>The most important thing is logical deduction, not speed.</p>
<br> 
<h3>Good luck and have fun !</h3>
