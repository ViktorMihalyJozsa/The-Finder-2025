THE FINDER ...


How to use and rules of the search game:

~ The game is played on a grid game board, which can be of different sizes depending on the
difficulty level (easy, medium, hard).

~ The player's goal is to discover all the squares without
clicking on a target.

~ The targets are randomly placed on the board and the player
has to mark them with flags.

~ The player can discover squares by left-clicking and mark
targets by right-clicking.

~ The game ends when the player discovers a target (loses),
or when all squares have been discovered and all targets have been correctly marked (wins).

~ A timer measures the playing time and the player can
try to solve the board as quickly as possible.

~ The game can be restarted by pressing the main button and the difficulty level can
be selected from the drop-down menu.
