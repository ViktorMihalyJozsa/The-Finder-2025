# THE FINDER 2025

A JavaScript-based Finder-style game created by VMJ & ASK.

The Finder is an engaging grid-based game where players must strategically uncover squares while avoiding hidden targets.

~ The player can discover squares by left-clicking and mark
targets by right-clicking.

~ The game ends when the player discovers a target (loses),
or when all squares have been discovered and all targets have been correctly marked (wins).

~ A timer measures the playing time and the player can
try to solve the board as quickly as possible.

~ The game can be restarted by pressing the main button and the difficulty level can
be selected from the drop-down menu.
